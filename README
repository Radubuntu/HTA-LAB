->Check JSfiddle examples for a simple HTML/CSS/JS example* Dont worry ;)

Based on the principle of the least effort (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort), 
We will try here to give some examples and templates to easily create graphical Windows applications just by using HTML.

Just read the code, the comments and then you will know where to paste your code.

*In the first examples we create a programm based on the JSFiddle's Jquery example. You dont really need to know about JSFiddle, 
what we work with is just a simple html, css and javascript (with jquery) code that is used as example there.
You may want to pay a visit at http://jsfiddle.net. It's a robust, easy to use and really great tool to writte web code on the fly.

HTML Application INFO
~ Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application ~
An HTML Application (HTA) is a Microsoft Windows program whose source code consists of HTML, Dynamic HTML, and one or more scripting 
languages supported by Internet Explorer, such as VBScript or JScript. 
The HTML is used to generate the user interface, and the scripting language is used for the program logic. 
An HTA executes without the constraints of the internet browser security model; in fact, it executes as a "fully trusted" application.
The usual file extension of an HTA is .hta.
~Uses~
HTAs give the developer the features of HTML together with the advantages of scripting languages. 
They are popular with Microsoft system administrators who use them for system administration from prototypes to "full-scale" applications, especially where flexibility and speed of development are critical.
~Info about the environment~  ********************************X-UA-Compatible headers**********************************************
By default, HTAs are rendered as per "standards-mode content in IE7 Standards mode and quirks mode content in IE5 (Quirks) mode", 
but this can be altered using X-UA-Compatible headers*. The HTA engine (mshta.exe) is dependent on Internet Explorer. 
Starting from Windows Vista, a user can remove Internet Explorer from Windows, which will cause the HTA engine to stop working.

* Needed meta-tag (HEAD) to work with modern browsers standards : <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=11"/>
